Purpose and contents
====================

The `Arduino IDE <https://www.arduino.cc/en/software>`_ is a very useful tool for programming boards for electronic projects. Included in the IDE is a serial monitor and a serial plotter. The monitor gives textual display of data coming from a connected board, and the plotter gives a graphical display. In both of these apps, a user may send data to a board as well.

While these apps are convenient, they lack features such as the ability to save data, operate a monitor and a plotter simultaneously, have a horizontal axis other than sample number, etc. **This package is to provide those features in a browser-based dashboard.**
